This is a pharmacy website prototype as it does not have actual ability to purchase items.
The goal of this website was for me to get comfortable with HTML, CSS and learn PHP with JS, I succeeded.
The design of the website was supposed to be more lively and more dynamic, but I needed to rework my structure, this is a lesson for next time.
A lot of new things I learned were at the end, such as header file, popups, sessions, meaning I would need to rework whole website to implement even better. I still really like my result, it is just less efficient.
The core parts are, log/register which create a session, in that session the user can add item from a catalogue which are then stored in a basket, upon logging out, the session closes and the basket clears (if I planned beforehand, I could\'92ve attempted to dynamically create databases, so each user would have there own). The user menu, is just to show my skills of showing the database, deleting from it and editing it (I am very proud of the edit part).
If this is being marked line by line, I apologise as this is a big project that I have done! Hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it.
